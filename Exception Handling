Exception Handling :
======================
Exception : An Unwanted, UnExpected Event that disturbs the normal flow of execution is called
Exception

Abnormal Termination : Without executing the rest of the code if program terminates Without
suddenly then it is called Abnormal Termination

It is higly recommended to handle the exception for smooth termination of application.

If Exception is not handled then it is always Abnormal Termination

Keywords related to Exception Handling
============================================
1)try
2)catch

3)finally

4)throws
5)throw


try:
================
1)Risky code we have to place inside try block
2)try block without catch or finally is not possible
3)if we want try with catch then order is try>catch
4)if we want try with finally then order is try>finally
5)if we want try with catch and finally then order is try>catch>finally
6)we can have multiple catch blocks for a single try block, but order of catch block must be
from child to parent

what is Risky Code :
===============================
The Code that may throw exception is called Risky Code


syntax of try block:
=========================
try{
    // risky code
}


catch block:
===========================
1)Inside catch block we place handling code
2)catch block cannot exist independently

syntax:
=================
catch(ExceptionName variableName){
    // Handling code
}

Note : Object is the root class for all classes in java
       Throwable is root class for all exceptions in java
       a)Exception
       b)Error

finally block:
========================
1)To place Re-Source Clean up logic, finally block is the best choice
2)finally block will get executed always (i.e with execption and without exception)

ex : closing the file
     closing the connection with database
     nullifying the object

syntax:
=======================
finally{
    // clean up logic
}


checked Exception :
============================
1)Exceptions those are checked by compiler at the time of Compilation are called Checked Exceptions
2)For checked exceptions compulsorily we have to use try catch or throws

  Examples:
  ====================
  1)IOException
  2)SQLException

UnChecked Exception :
============================
1)Exceptions those are not checked by compiler at the time of Compilation are called UnChecked Exceptions


  Examples:
  ====================
  1)NumberFormatException
  2)ArithmeticException
  3)ClassCastException
  4)NullPointerException
  5)ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException


throws:
===================
1)throws keyword delegates the responsibility of exception handling to the caller method
2)In General throws cannot avoid abormal termination
3)we have to use throws after method parameters

void f1() throws ExceptionName{
    
}
